arduino-airquality
==================

In this project, we are building a mobile Arduino Fio based platform to measure air quality.

We currently have multiple components working correctly with the Arduino Fio:

- [x] GPS sensor - Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout v3 and the OpenLog
- [x] Dust sensor - Sharp Optical Dust Sensor
- [x] Humidity and temperature sensor - SHT10 by sensiron/DFRobot
- [x] Carbon monoxide sensor - Parallax CO sensor
- [x] Barometric pressure - BMP085 Barometric Pressure/Temperature/Altitude Sensor

We are working on combining them all into a nice light package.

Still to do:
- [ ] Create circuit board sketch and etch it
- [ ] Solder everything on board
- [ ] Build enclosure
